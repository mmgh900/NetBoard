This is a TicTocToe game that I made as my university project.

This project was a good practice to get familiar with network and Java object-oriented programming.

These are some features of the game: *Play on a local network with friends *Play multiplayer on one computer *Play with advanced AI 
*Create accounts and login to them *Password recovery by secret Q&A *WONDERFUL TIME-TAKEN UI :)

How to run: Use a java IDE and add the JavaFX library "lib" folder to the project. First, run ServerMain and then ClientMain in src/mains

Note: If you got an error like: "Can't find the file" create a file named "clientProfiles.dat" and put it in ServerSaves

if there was any other errors or problems is the running process PLEASE email me and ask: gheysari.mm@gmail.com
